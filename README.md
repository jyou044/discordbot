# discordbot
This is a discord bot I created through use of Python. It's a fun, interactive bot that is capable of sending GIFs to captioned images

## Overview
- The code for the photo-caption generation command was inspired by https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/discord-meme-maker-bot
### Commands
- **$yogiHelp**: Sends a list of commands users can use to interact with the bot.
- **$yogi**: Sends one of "Bonjour!", "I love donuts!", or "D'OH!".
- **$photo**: Sends randomized photo with user inputted caption.
- **$meme**: Sends randomized GIF.
- **$guess**: The yogibot randomly selects a number between 1 and 20, then asks the user to guess the number that is chosen.
- When you ping the bot, it will respond with a list of commands users can use, similar to the yogiHelp command.
# Current Version
- Simple Text Commands and user interaction
- Added Randomized Picture with caption & GIF Commands
